## Data ##
Create the data using Python and split it into training set and test set.

## Tasks ##
1) Create a neural network with 3 hidden layers for a classification problem
2) Define inputs,classes, neurons for each hidden layer and load the dataset
3) Implement a forward pass
3) Implement a backpropagation
4) Use gradient descent to update weights
5) Compute the training error with mini batches

## Output ##
We get a visual representation of the data that the Neural Network succesfully classsified.
